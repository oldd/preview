# GitHub Repos 1
Finished code isn't a finished project.  Navigable and helpful GitHub repositories are finished projects. Fortunately git provides all the tools necessary to organize your code in a developer-friendly way and GitHub provides a great interface for exploring well-organized projects.

Building a good repo is a little tricky and will take some practice.  It requires careful planning and extra attention through your development process.  At the end you will have something that looks like this: [A complete repository](https://github.com/elium-student/my-first-repo).

### What makes a good repo?

You will begin implementing these features in week 1 project:
* [An informative README](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)
* [Version tags](http://semver.org) - versions are fully functional releases, they can be downloaded and run without crashing.
* Branches - gh-pages branch, master release branch. 
* gh-pages demo
*tests - for now, simple hand-build testing suites

Later in the course we will discuss how to use these features in a repo:
* documentation - wiki, gh-pages, markdown.  There are many ways to do this
* Full testing suites
* Contributing guidelines - ideas for contributors, code of conduct, ...
* Github projects - for organizing collaborative directly in the repo
* Pull requests and issues

This lesson is the first in a series of lessons that will cover how to use GitHub to organize your entire development process.  This series will include lessons on Agile and Scrum methodologies by Juan David and will culminate in the final colaborative projects in the last 4 weeks of this program.
