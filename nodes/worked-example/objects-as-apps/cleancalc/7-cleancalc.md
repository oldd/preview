# CLEANCALC v.7.* - Single Page App + API

### Implementation:
Check out this example -- build a link (like tictactoes 4 but with one server)

When the server is accessed at '/', send an HTML page and the axios scripts necessary to access the calc object.  Your cleancalc object will live in the backend and be accessed via axios calls to things like '/add' or '/multiply'.
