Of course developers work with code.  what do they do with code?
* it's not writing code
* it's reading code
* and maintining code

and when they're not dealing with code, they're dealing with people
* eachother to plan, code review, and bug fix
* team leaders to keep projects on focus and on track
* customers, marketers, ... everyone else

your code ultimately isn't written for you. 

This sounds like a whole bunch of different things, how to learn them all?
by recognizing the two skills that underly it all
- communication
- collaborative problem solving

This isn't to minimize programming.  at the end of the day, if your code doesn't cut it you're letting your team down. but that's the easy part, it comes naturally with time.  this other stuff takes a stronger effort

So maybe this boils down to semantics, but that changes nothing but what you call it.  The more important skill, and the one that's harder to learn, is the problem solving, communication and collaboration.

## Communication
To begin understanding programming as communication, it's important to think about who need to understand your code after you've written.
* computers
* users
* developers
 


----
Software development is a collaborative problem solving process using ever-changing tools to communicate a changing message.  Code - the final product of development - needs to be understood by 3 very different audiences: computers, users, and developers.

Given this description, let's define the basic skills of a developer:
* coding, of course
* communication and team work
* self-directed learning
* creative problem solving

only one of those has to do with programming directly!  This course is created to help you integrate those three skills into your programming.
