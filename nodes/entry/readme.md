Hi there

You are about to embark on a learning journey different from anything you've seen before.  This content will require a higher level of disciplined study than most videos, tutorials or courses you've followed online.  But don't worry - we'll provide you with guidance in this folder and on Slack. 

This entry node is meant to be used as a constant reference point as you work your way through the rest of the content. While the rest of the nodes contain specific skills that build on previous skills, this one contains more general information that will be of use through your entire journey.

In this course, it doesn't matter what your projects do or what libraries they use.  What will matter is how they're designed, the process you went through to build them, and the way you think about what you're doing.  This approach takes more effort, but will pay off.  We promise.

Take a look through these pages before moving on.
