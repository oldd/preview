Hi there

You are about to embark on a learning journey different from anything you've seen before.  This content will require a higher level of engagement than most videos, tutorials or courses you've followed online. 

This entry node is meant to be used as a constant reference point as you work your way through the rest of the content. While the rest of the nodes contain specific skills that build on previous nodes, this one contains more general information that will be of use through your entire journey.

In this course, it doesn't matter what your projects do or what frameworks they use.  What will matter is how they're designed, the process you went through to build them, and the way you think about what you're doing.  This approach takes more effort, but will more than pay off.

There are certain things you should be familiar with before going on, including our recommendations for how to best follow this curriculum.

* [developering](./developering.md)

* [how to use](./how-to.md)
* [pre-recs](./pre-recs.md)
* [vocab list](vocab-list.md)
