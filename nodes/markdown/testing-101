## Intro

Testing is an empassioned topic.  If you search online you'll find great debates over which frameworks to use and how to fit tests into your development cycle.  Underlying all sides of the arguments are a few universal concepts.  This lesson will attempt to teach the universal fundamentals then set you off on the right track to learn the rest.

The first part of this lesson will cover testing fundamentals culminating in the backbone of (almost) all testing paradigms and frameworks - the test suite: 
1. [Pure Functions](#pure-functions)
2. [Specifications](#specs)
3. [Unit Tests](#unit-tests)
4. [Test Suites](#all-together-now)
  
The second part of this lesson will give some ideas for incorporating testing into your dev process, and introduce our favorite testing framework:  
5. [BDD, TDD](#bdd-and-tdd)  
6. [Minimal Passing Functions](#minimal-passing-functions)  
7. [Gradual Refactoring](#gradual-refactoring)  
8. [Jasmine, testing framework](#jasmine)

## Specs
Specs are a crucial part of planning code before writing code.  If you are going to follow the TDD or BDD testing paradigms, it's best you get a hang of these now.

A specification is plain text that describes everything needed for someone to build code with a given functionality.  If specs are well written (and well followed) all implementations will be interchangeable.   My code may be faster than yours, and hers may be easier to read, and his uses less memory, but we could close our eyes to pick one and the application will still work the same.  
  
If you are careful to build pure functions you only need to specify 3 things to fully describe your code: 
1. ARGUMENTS:  The number of arguments your function needs and the type of each one. 
2. RETURN TYPE: The type of whatever is to the right of your return statement.  If there is no return statement, Javascript defaults to returning 'undefined'.   
3. BEHAVIOR:  A high level description of what happens between the curly braces. If this gets longer than 2 lines you should think about breaking your function into littler functions.

Specs for the division function above.  It's import that everything is spelt the same in your specs and your function:
* division: function  
  * ARGS: 2  
    * a: number  
    * b: number
  * RETURN: number  
  * BEHAVIOR: Divides a by b, if b is not 0.  Returns the result or 'undefined', depending on the inputs.

## Unit Tests

Unit Tests are the simplest possible example of something called a __higher order function__.  Higher order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments.  Let's take a look at some specs for a unit test to see how they work: 
* unit_test: function
  * ARGS: 1
    * testee: function
  * RETURN: boolean
  * BEHAVIOR: Executes testee with a hard-coded set of arguments and compares the returned value against an expected result.  Returns true or fals according to the comparison.

These are the atoms of all testing.  You build unit tests for each function (or method) based on it's specs.
  
Below is a series of unit tests for the division function.  Coming up with a good collection of unit tests means determining what are the important classifications of input/output pairs and testing each one.  The principle is very simple. Coming up with them is easy but time consuming.  Coming up with good ones is challenging and worth the effort.  There is no better way to understand a function than coming up with a good set of test cases.  

```javascript
function test_1_division(testee) {  // positive, positive
	var a = 3;
	var b = 3;
	var expected = 1;
	var result = testee(a, b);
	if(result == expected) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	};
};
function test_2_division(testee) { // negative, negative
	var a = -3;
	var b = -3;
	var expected = 1;
	var result = testee(a, b);
	if(result == expected) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	};
};
function test_3_division(testee) { // positive, negative
	var a = 3;
	var b = -3;
	var expected = -1;
	var result = testee(a, b);
	if(result == expected) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	};
};
function test_4_division(testee) { // negative, positive
	var a = -3;
	var b = 3;
	var expected = -1;
	var result = testee(a, b);
	if(result == expected) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	};
};
function test_5_division(testee) { // non-0, 0
	var a = 3;
	var b = 0;
	var expected = undefined;
	var result = testee(a, b);
	if(result == expected) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	};
};
function test_6_division(testee) { // 0, non-0
	var a = 0;
	var b = 3;
	var expected = 0;
	var result = testee(a, b);
	if(result == expected) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	};
};
```
(Take a moment to notice how much more difficult this would be if testee weren't a pure function.)

## Test Suites
The __testing suite__ is what ties this all together.   It's no huge conceptual leap forward, but it makes life a lot easier.  
This one isn't a pure function, what would you have to change to make it one?
```javascript
function division_test_suite(testee) {
	var result = [];
	if(test_1_division(testee)) {  // +/+
		result.push('PASS +/+');
	} else {
		result.push('fail +/+');
	};
	if(test_2_division(testee)) {  // -/-
		result.push('PASS -/-');
	} else {
		result.push('fail -/-');
	};
	if(test_3_division(testee)) {  // +/-
		result.push('PASS +/-');
	} else {
		result.push('fail +/-');
	};
	if(test_4_division(testee)) {  // -/+
		result.push('PASS -/+');
	} else {
		result.push('fail -/+');
	};
	if(test_5_division(testee)) {  // +/0
		result.push('PASS +/0');
	} else {
		result.push('fail +/0');
	};
	if(test_6_division(testee)) {  // 0/+
		result.push('PASS 0/+');
	} else {
		result.push('fail 0/+');
	};
	return result;
};
```

## NLS Test Suite

If you're a real programmer you'll be annoyed by all the repetition in the above testing suite. 

figure out how to use all this stuff:

```javascript
function unit_test(testee, args, expected) {
    var result = testee(...args);
    return result == expected;
};

function division(a, b) {
	var result = 0000;
	// logic
	return result;
};

var division_test_cases = [
    { args: [3, 3], expected: 1, name: '+/+' },
    { args: [-3, -3], expected: 1, name: '-/-' },
    { args: [3, -3], expected: -1, name: '+/-' },
    { args: [-3, 3], expected: -1, name: '-/+' },
    { args: [3, 0], expected: undefined, name: 'non-0/0' },
    { args: [0, 3], expected: 0, name: '0/non-0' }
];

function test_suite(test, testee, cases) {
    var results = [];
    for(var test_case in cases) {
        result.push(test(testee, test_case.args, test_case.expected)); 
    };
    return results;
};

function result_interpreter(test_results, test_cases) {
    var interpretation = [];
    for(var i = 0; i < test_results.length; i++) {
        if(test_results[i]) {
            interpretation.push('PASS: ' + test_cases[i].name);
        } else {
            interpretation.push('fail: ' + test_cases[i].name);
        };
    };
    return interpretation;
};
```

## Minimal Passing Functions
You've just seen testing suites and heard of B/Tdd, but how does it all happen?

Testing suites in conjuntion with _minimal passing functions_ can be used to organize your development process, helping you to make sure you aren't overcomplicating your work or taking any unnecessary detours.  

This is the heart of the *DD development philosophies. 

A minimal passing function is just the simplest possible function that will pass it's unit test.  To the point of uselessness.  The example below contains a unit test and a simplest passing function for addition:
 
```javascript
function additionTester(testee) {
	var tested = testee(4, 5);
	var message = '';
	if (tested == 9) {
		message = 'success';
	} else {
		message = 'failure';
	};
	return message;
};

function addition(a, b) {
	return 9;
};
```
This minimal function seems useless, it just returns the right answer!  A simplest passing function will do nothing but pass the test.   That's the goal in *DD. If the test asks for an array, the function returns an array.  If the test asks for 'Chlotilde', the function returns 'Chlotilde'.  If the test asks to salt and hash a user's password, that's what it does.

Once a function passes one test, you refactor it a bit to pass more tests and to be better code.  Test it again.  Refactor. Repeat, and you're on your way to *DD.

## Gradual Refactoring

Using unit tests and minimal functions probably won't come naturally.  Here are a few steps you can practice to begin incorporating them into your development process:
1. Write your _empty code_ (all necessary functions/objects/variables with nothing between the curly braces) according to your specs:     
    ```javascript
    function addition(a, b) {
    }; // (this would be more intersting in a larger program)
    ```
2. Fill it in with dummy return values of the right type so it 'works' (you can call everything without it breaking, but nothing happens):
    ```javascript
    function addition(a, b) {
        var sum = 0000;
        // logic
        return sum
    };
    ```
3. While project isn't finished:
    1. make a separate branch for the feature/module/function you are working on.
    2. gradually test->pass->refactor that bit of code gradually upping your test-passing expectations with each iteration. Shoot for new fringe cases, trickier inputs, it's almost a game between you and the test writer:
        ```javascript
        // Can you guess what test conditions were passed with each new step?
        function addition(a, b) {    // first iteration
            var sum = 0000;
            // logic
            return sum;
        };
        function addition(a, b) {    // second iteration
            var sum = 0000;
            sum = a + b;
            return sum;
        };
        function addition(a, b) {    // third iteration
            var sum = 0000;
            if ((typeof(a)=='number') && (typeof(b)=='number')) {
                sum = a + b;
            };
            return sum;
        };
        function addition(a, b) {    // final iteration
            var result;
            if ((typeof(a)=='number') && (typeof(b)=='number')) {
                result = a + b;
            } else {
                result = undefined;
            };
            return sum;
        };
        ```
        (It's important that you only modify the single piece of code while on it's branch. If you planned well from the beginning it shouldn't depend on anything else to pass it's tests)
    3. After the branch is finished, merge it back into master.
4. Launch first version, and continue *DD on a meta (application and users) level.

## BDD and TDD

The *DD method of development requires you to plan before you write code - always a good thing. It also keeps you from spending hours writing the logic for your functions just to find out they don't 'fit together'. 

Before starting to write code you must have specs and tests prepared. The development process then becomes a matter of passing one test at a time until they're all passed.  If you've planned your project well, all passing tests means a working application.

That's all on testing for now.
