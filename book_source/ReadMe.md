# Welcome to JankeLearning!

* what's this all about
  * software development is people collaborating to provide a solution to an end user's needs.
  * code is an important tool along the way, but it can distract from the ultimate purpose
  * we aim to teach development as a holistic, and very human, endeavor that incorporates programming but is not programming
* what this covers
  * general problem solving and learning skills
  * understanding code as a text that needs to be read by 3 audiences
  * tools and practices that enable collaborative programming
* our approach
  * software development is a prime example of an intrinsically complex task
  * main challenges to address from a pedagogical side
    * cognitive load
    * skill transfer (procedural knowledge)
    * metal models
    * a term for being able to communicate your thoughts - dev audience and self
  * we try to embed pedagogy from our personal experience and findings findings from research into this content
  * The format is intentional.  The content is all hosted on github and is either markdown or code to study.  This will enable you to get constant expereince with the tools of the trade, automating the skills of termainl/editor/browser development and dealing nested file structures
  * uses JS because of multi-paradigms and ubiquity
  * stay tuned for a more thorough explanation of our methods including a list of annotated citations and guidelines for contribution.
* Learn some stuff!

________

We believe at least 1/2 of developering has nothing to do with lines code.  It's thinking and studying skills, communication, collaboration, project planning and high-level understanding of application design.  
These skills are central to any and all types of development - web, mobile, desktop - and translate easily between disciplines and languages. 
It has also been our experience from teaching development that these skills can be learned at the same time, and sometimes before, students can solve difficult code-war style problems - the usual measure of developer ability.
  
programming can be thought of as strategizing, with the restriction that computers can carry out your strategy

Given that the foundational skills of software development are cross-discipline, and that these skills can be built very early in a developer's learning process, we believe there should exist an open curriculum to teach these skills to beginner and intermediate developers alike.
There are many outstanding free and open learning resources - but in our experience they focus on specific tools and techniques, language fundamentals, or getting your code from level 2 to level 5.  We provide links to our favorites in the 'support' section of this teaser.  
We like to think of this curriculum as the glue between existing resources.
