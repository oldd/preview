## About Us

[JankeLearning](https://jankelearning.github.io) is an open project aiming to provide the best possible resources for bridging the gap between computer programming and human communication.  
We combine our personal experience in teaching, development and communication with current research in cognition and learning to produce the most effective study paths we can.  

Instructional design was developed in partnership with [Elewa Education](http://elewa.education).
