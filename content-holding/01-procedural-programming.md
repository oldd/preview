# Procedural Programming
This is just some vocab to describe what already comes naturally.

The core features of procedural programming are: 
* Reusable procedures.
* Simple data types.
* Control Flow
* A seris of executable statements. 

Any JS program you'ce written so far meets these criteria:
* Functions are your procedures.
* JS has native data types.
* While/for loops, if statements, and JS's top-to-bottom execution comprise your control flow tools.
* A JS file with a series of variable declarations and funciton calls is your procedrual program.

There you have it.  Procedural programming is the typical 'programs are recipes' paradigm that comes naturally at the beginning of the learning process.
