convert your pseudocode into code:

	if a property is present, check it's type
		if it's type is right
			say it's all good
		else 
			replace it with the fallback and say you did
	else
		say it was gone and put in the fallback
	if there's an extra property
		alert the user

-------------------------------------------------------

	if (property is not undefined) {
		if (property is right type) {
			message += 'all good'
		} else {
			property = fallback 
			message += 'type was bad, replaced'
		}
	} else {
		property = fallback
		message += 'prop was absent, fallback inserted'
	}
	if (property is not in schema) {
		message += 'extra property detected'
	}
