Organize the conditional checks according to the principles of conditional checks:
	Mutually Exclusive   ->  if/else statement
	Logically Dependant  ->  nested if statments
	Logically Indpendant ->  if statements at the same level of code


Write pseudocode 

	if a property is present, check it's type
		if it's type is right
			say it's all good
		else 
			replace it with the fallback and say you did
	else
		say it was gone and put in the fallback
	if there's an extra property
		alert the user
