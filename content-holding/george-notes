videos
	for each worked example and project
	definitely for the precourse
	make list of faq's
	video riens codealongs?

prettier markdown
	markdown to powerpoint?
	other ways to unify markdowns?

less pure browser by hand
	

more node/dev stuff
	fit in earlier and thorougher
	first as build environment for front-end only?
		intro to modules, cool ones
		workflow practice - with auto-build tools

projects
	ditch battleship
	keep cleancalc and tictactoe
	more buildy projects like youtube
	on project per
		npm
		modules
		building
		...
	a bigger end-of-course project
		with solutions
		a project assignment 
		a target - for legitimacy
		resume stuffer
		us for focus as we build content
		to be done in groups

first three/4 weeks
	js/css
	build stuff pretty and fast
	static react components, + styling

js/adv-js 
	same exercise - both ways
	ie. 'this' in es6 vs es5 function
	scope/context - physical props

students as ambassadors 
	make them meet certain standards
		- to qualify as 'certified'
		final project
		github cv/portfolio



curriculum design considerations
	maximize
		skill transfer
		exposure to realistic workflow
		our personal workflow - maintenance, development.  eventually, contributors?
		self-studyability
		opportunities for peer interaction - grading, projects, ...
		process-oriented objectives
		"check points" - accountability
			friendly competition - reward-wise
			in teams, succeeding together is better
			milestone due dates
		assessment - 
			(peer, self) as much for "reflective practitionership" as anything
			us (formative/diagnostic) - to direct for further study
			us (assessive) - final project, portfolios
			sololearn into google forms - for grouping students too
		physicalize it - print out check sheets for projects/weeks/conceptual
			part of accountability and self-assessment
			on-hand printout
				asking questions, studying, js basics, vocab, ...
				1-1 for first phase, a couple for second phase, none for later phases
		gamification/interaction
	minimize
		extraneous cognitive load
			printout lists
		student uncertainty - in conceptual direction or learning objectives
			- if they're confused, it should be because the concept is hard
		points of access for students
		results-oriented objectives
	things for us to consider
		cognitive load
		reflective practitioner
		threshold concepts - be aware of them, make them clear to students, assess at these points
		notional machines - see "threshold concepts"
			physical things exercises 
			assessments at these points
		supporting resources - quantity, quality, proximity, role
		4c/id - seems to encompass all the above
			a blueprint for us to follow, a consistent format for students
